	Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

Hints:
	#44: Try a Hash Table
	#117: Could a bit vector be useful?
	#132: Can you solve it in O(N log N) time? What might a soluion like that look like.

Good Questions:
	Is the string ASCII or UNICODE?
	Are you allowed to modify the input string?
