String Rotation:
	Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given
	two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to
	isSubstring.

	Example
	"waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat"
Hints:
	#34: If a string is a rotation of another, then it's a rotation at a particular point. For example,
	a rotation of waterbottle at character 3 means cutting waterbottle at character 3 and putting the
	right half before the left half.
	#88: We are essentially asking if there's a way of splitting the first string into two parts, x
	and y, such that the first string is xy and the second string is yx.
	#104: Think about what happens when you concatenate erbottlewat to itself.
